    <h1>The Impact of FinTech on the Financial Industry</h1>
    <div #diagramContainer></div>
    <h2>Money Transfers: Convenience at Your Fingertips</h2>
    <p>One of the most significant impacts of FinTech is in the domain of money transfers. With the widespread use of
        smartphones, an increasing number of people are relying on their mobile devices for banking tasks like checking
        balances, transferring funds, and paying bills. FinTech companies like PhonePe and PayTM have taken this
        convenience a step further by providing user-friendly mobile apps that enable seamless money transfers. In
        India, the introduction of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has revolutionized the way transactions are
        conducted, making them quick, easy, and reliable. This not only enhances convenience but also extends financial
        services to those who may have previously been excluded from traditional banking systems.</p>

    <h2>Investing: Democratizing Access to Financial Markets</h2>
    <p>FinTech is also democratizing access to financial markets through online investing platforms. Companies like
        Zerodha and Groww have made it possible for anyone, irrespective of their financial background, to invest in
        stocks, bonds, and other securities without the need for a traditional stockbroker. These platforms provide
        users with easy access to information about different investment options, enabling individuals to make
        well-informed decisions about their money. By breaking down barriers to entry and simplifying the investment
        process, FinTech is empowering individuals to take control of their financial future.</p>

    <h2>Neo Banking: Branchless Banking for the Digital Age</h2>
    <p>While traditional banks have been focused on improving branch operations, a new wave of branchless banking has
        emerged in the form of neo banks. Companies like Jupiter offer comprehensive banking services directly from
        mobile devices. With a focus on user experience, neo banks provide seamless and intuitive mobile interfaces,
        allowing customers to perform all banking activities from the convenience of their smartphones. Additionally,
        these modern banking solutions offer innovative features such as net worth estimation, providing users with a
        holistic view of their financial health.</p>

    <h2>Financial Education: Empowering Individuals to Make Well-Informed Decisions</h2>
    <p>As FinTech continues to reshape the financial landscape, it is crucial to prioritize financial education. Many
        FinTech companies, such as Cred and Zerodha, have recognized this need and have launched services to educate
        individuals about different investment options and the various fees applied by banks. By equipping individuals
        with knowledge and tools to understand their financial behavior and work towards their financial goals, FinTech
        is empowering users to make well-informed decisions about their money. However, it is essential for consumers to
        remain vigilant about potential risks and take measures to ensure the security of their personal information.
    </p>

    <p>In conclusion, FinTech is revolutionizing the way we manage our finances. From mobile banking to online
        investing, these technologies are making financial management more convenient and accessible for individuals. As
        the world continues to embrace digitalization, FinTech will undoubtedly play a vital role in shaping the future
        of finance. However, it is crucial for consumers to stay informed, exercise caution, and prioritize the security
        of their personal information in this rapidly evolving landscape. By leveraging the benefits of FinTech while
        being mindful of potential risks, individuals can navigate the financial world with confidence and seize the
        opportunities presented by this technological revolution.</p>
