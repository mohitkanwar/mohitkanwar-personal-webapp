<h3>FIDO Authentication Flow</h3>
<h4>FIDO2 and WebAuthn</h4>
<h5>Registration</h5>
<img src="assets/mmd/tech/fido-registration.png" alt="Fido registration process explained" class="responsive-image">

<p>The client generates a new key pair and requests the authenticator to create credentials for the user.</p>
<p>The authenticator creates the credentials and returns a public key to the client.</p>
<p>The client sends the public key and additional registration data to the server.</p>
<p>The server verifies the data and registers the user, associating the public key with the user's account.</p>
<h5>Authentication</h5>
<p>When authentication is required, the client requests authentication from the authenticator.</p>
<p>The authenticator verifies the user's identity using stored credentials and generates an authentication assertion.</p>
<p>The client sends the authentication assertion to the server.</p>
<p>The server validates the assertion using the stored public key associated with the user's account.</p>
<img src="assets/mmd/tech/fido-authentication.png" alt="Fido authentication process explained" class="responsive-image">
