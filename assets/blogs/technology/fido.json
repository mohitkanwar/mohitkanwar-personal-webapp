Its adoption represents a crucial step towards a more secure and user-centric authentication paradigm.\nFIDO (Fast Identity Online) revolutionizes authentication by employing strong cryptographic principles, eliminating the need for passwords. Its functionality revolves around three primary components: authenticators, clients, and servers.\n### Components in FIDO Authentication\n#### Authenticators\nThese are the devices responsible for user authentication. Authenticators can be hardware-based (like USB security keys) or built into devices (biometric sensors or TPMs). They securely store user credentials and generate cryptographic keys used in the authentication process.\n#### Clients\nThe client represents the user's device or browser where authentication occurs. It interacts with the authenticator and the server during the authentication process. Web browsers, native mobile apps, or desktop applications can act as FIDO clients.\n#### Servers\nServers manage user authentication. They interact with the client and the authenticator to verify user identities. The server validates authentication requests, confirming the user's identity without receiving sensitive information like passwords.\n<img src=\"assets/mmd/tech/fido-components.png\" alt=\"The different FIDO components\" class=\"responsive-image\">\n### FIDO Authentication Flow\n#### FIDO2 and WebAuthn\n##### Registration\n<img src=\"assets/mmd/tech/fido-registration.png\" alt=\"Fido registration process explained\" class=\"responsive-image\">\nThe client generates a new key pair and requests the authenticator to create credentials for the user.\nThe authenticator creates the credentials and returns a public key to the client.\nThe client sends the public key and additional registration data to the server.\nThe server verifies the data and registers the user, associating the public key with the user's account.\n\n##### Authentication\nWhen authentication is required, the client requests authentication from the authenticator.\nThe authenticator verifies the user's identity using stored credentials and generates an authentication assertion.\nThe client sends the authentication assertion to the server.\nThe server validates the assertion using the stored public key associated with the user's account.\n<img src=\"assets/mmd/tech/fido-authentication.png\" alt=\"Fido authentication process explained\" class=\"responsive-image\">\n#### Technical Process\n##### Cryptographic Operations\nFIDO employs asymmetric cryptographic operations using public and private keys to create secure authentication credentials.\nPublic keys are used to verify signatures while private keys are securely stored on the authenticator.\n##### Secure Authentication\nFIDO's reliance on hardware-backed security and biometrics ensures a higher level of security compared to traditional password-based systems.\nCredentials are bound to specific devices or biometric attributes, reducing the risk of phishing or unauthorized access.\nBy leveraging robust cryptographic principles and hardware-backed security, FIDO2 and WebAuthn redefine authentication, offering a more secure and user-friendly alternative to traditional password-based systems.\n### Implementing FIDO authentication in applications involves a few key steps\n1.
