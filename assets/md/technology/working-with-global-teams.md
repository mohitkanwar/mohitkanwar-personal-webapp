# Experience
I have had the experience of working with customers across the globe. I have worked with teams in India, U.S.A, Canada, Africa, Australia, Middle East, Europe, East Asia. That covers pretty much the whole globe.

Working with diverse cultures help you understand the different cultures and how the different traditions evolved. 
I have realized that we are so different, yet so same at the core.

some shocking incidents - In India, the third genders are generally quite repressed. but I observed their indulgence in normal life as bus operators, as bankers in other countries. 

dependency on electricity - In India, we have a lot of manual things, that we don't realize. Once in europe, there was a problem with electricity, and people inside mall were stuck. no-one could go in, no one could come out because there was a power cut.

Speaking same language is more important than political relations. India and Pakistan do not have good relations. India is so diverse, that my friend from tamil nadu didn't understood hindi, that is my mothertongue. so I was speaking to him in english. while the pakistani guy and myself bonded well due to both being affluent in hindi/punjabi.
The onlookers were confused because with the person from my own country, I was using english, but with the person from an enemy country I was using my mothertongue.

poorness is not limited to India
When I was kid, i was told that foreign countries are so rich that they build roads with marbles. The houses are made up of gold and what not. 
All this bhrams were broken when I travelled across the globe. Problems are similar across the world.

Food
The food choices vary according to the different conditions. Non-veg food is prevalant. Even Indian food doesn't tastes the same across. The palates of people outside is also different, they actually do not like the Indian food as Indians do. Dutch people like to have cold food, which is very odd to my tongue. Thailand people do have non-veg even in breakfasts.

Advantages of working with different cultures
- Understanding of global traditions
- better understanding of human psychology
- Gaining empathy
- Learning and adopting the things that I can improve

Disadvantages
- working with people who do not have a common language is very difficult
- while none of us is being rude, the language and culture differences might feel that the other person is rude. and that may lead to conflicts
- lot of time spent in discussing very simple things. Translators do not work well.

# Embracing Global Diversity: Insights from a World of Experiences

At the onset of my career, the allure of working "On-Site" was a shared aspiration among my peers and me. The prospect of immersing ourselves in diverse cultures, collaborating closely with customers, and gaining insights into varied business operations was enticing. On-site assignments promised not just professional growth but also a glimpse into a world previously beyond our reach.

However, transitioning from core product development to customer-facing roles was a hurdle. Yet, the door to global experiences swung open when I joined Xebia as a trainer. Suddenly, I found myself traversing continents, training teams in countries spanning Netherlands, Mauritius, Bahrain, Qatar, the Philippines, Thailand, and more.

The rich tapestry of cultures, traditions, and ways of life encountered during these journeys has been transformative. Working with customers worldwide and teams across India, the U.S.A, Canada, Africa, Australia, the Middle East, Europe, and East Asia has been nothing short of a global odyssey.

Diving into diverse cultures isn't merely eye-opening; it's a journey into understanding the evolution of traditions. Amidst the apparent differences, a profound realization emerges – at our core, we're strikingly similar.

Some incidents left indelible impressions. Witnessing the repressed third genders in India living full lives as bus operators and bankers in other countries shattered preconceptions. Dependency on electricity, often taken for granted, hit home during a power cut in Europe, where people were marooned inside malls.

Surprising encounters redefined perceptions. Language bridged divides more effectively than political relations. The paradox of conversing in English with a fellow Indian due to language barriers, while bonding effortlessly with a Pakistani in our native tongues, left bystanders baffled.

Travel dispelled myths of opulence in foreign lands. The stark reality of shared human challenges globally shattered misconceptions of marble roads and golden houses.

Food, a cultural cornerstone, reflected unique palettes worldwide. Variations in taste transformed perceptions of even familiar cuisines like Indian food, revealing its diverse avatars across continents.

Navigating these diverse experiences unveiled distinct advantages. Understanding global traditions, a deeper grasp of human psychology, cultivating empathy, and a constant drive for self-improvement emerged as invaluable outcomes.

Yet, challenges linger. Communicating without a common language poses obstacles, leading to misunderstandings that can escalate into conflicts. Cultural and linguistic differences sometimes breed unintended rudeness, complicating interactions and discussions.

Despite these challenges, the lessons from this global journey resonate. Each encounter with diversity enriches perspectives, fostering an understanding that transcends borders. Embracing global diversity isn't just about celebrating differences; it's about finding common ground amid the beautiful mosaic of cultures.

In retrospect, these experiences underscore the essence of embracing diversity – a journey that's as enlightening as it is enriching.

## A Deeper Dive into Global Diversity

Beyond the surface-level encounters lies a deeper understanding of the significance and impact of embracing global diversity.

### Understanding the Essence of Cultural Diversity

The global experiences I've encountered serve as a testament to the richness of cultural diversity. It's not merely about observing different customs or rituals; it's about comprehending the historical, social, and psychological underpinnings that shape these diverse cultures. This deeper understanding fosters a profound appreciation for the complexities and intricacies of human societies across the globe.

### The Role of Empathy in Cross-Cultural Interactions

Empathy becomes a guiding light when navigating the labyrinth of diverse cultural norms. It's not just about acknowledging differences; it's about stepping into the shoes of others, understanding their perspectives, and embracing their worldview. Cultivating empathy enables meaningful connections, fostering a sense of shared humanity that transcends geographical boundaries.

### Harnessing Diversity for Innovation and Growth

The synergy derived from diverse perspectives fuels innovation and growth. Each cultural lens offers a unique viewpoint, challenging conventional thinking and stimulating creativity. Embracing these diverse ideas nurtures a culture of innovation, driving organizations and societies towards greater success and resilience in an ever-evolving global landscape.

### Bridging Divides for a Harmonious World

Embracing global diversity isn't merely a professional endeavor; it's a step towards fostering a more harmonious world. By bridging cultural divides, nurturing mutual respect, and celebrating differences, we pave the way for a world where diversity is not just tolerated but cherished and celebrated.

## Conclusion: Embracing the Tapestry of Humanity

In essence, the journey through global diversity is a pilgrimage through the tapestry of humanity itself. Each thread, unique in its color and texture, contributes to the breathtaking mosaic of cultures. Embracing these differences not only enriches our lives but also strengthens the bonds that weave us all together – the shared experience of being human.

The realization that despite our diverse backgrounds, aspirations, and traditions, we share a common desire for understanding, respect, and unity is the true essence of embracing global diversity.
