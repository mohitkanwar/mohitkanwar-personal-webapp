      The config file should have a name that is formated as:
          scully.<projectName>.config.ts

      If you meant to build a different project as undefined you can use:
          --project differentProjectName as a cmd line option

      When you are in a mixed mono-repo you might need to use the --pjFirst flag.
       which will look for package.json instead of angular.json to find the 'root' of the project.

         From now on, the plugin that is being used to render a route is
         able to be changed by the user. You can do this by adding or
         enabling the plugin in the scully.json file. For your convenience,
         we loaded the Puppeteer plugin for you.

         To disable this warning enable the plugin of your choice.
         for Puppteer please add:
             import '@scullyio/scully-plugin-puppeteer';
          to your scully.ang2-mohitkanwar.config.ts file.

          When you get this warning while not using scully-plugin-puppeteer
          you need to set the defaultRouteRenderer to the name of your plugin.

We encountered a problem while reading the routes from your applications source.
This might happen when there are lazy-loaded routes, that are not loaded,
Or when there are paths we can not resolve statically.
Check the routes in your app, rebuild and retry.
(You can inspect the error by passing the --showGuessError flag

When there are extraRoutes in your config, we will still try to render those.
