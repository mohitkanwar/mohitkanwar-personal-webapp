# My Personal Web App

Welcome to my personal web app repository! This application serves as my personal blog, which is accessible at [https://mohitkanwar.com](https://mohitkanwar.com).

## Getting Started

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/mohitkanwar/mohitkanwar-personal-webapp.git

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (LTS version) installed. You can download them from https://nodejs.org.

1. Open the code in your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).

1. Install project dependencies using npm:
    ```shell 
    npm install
    ```
1. Perform an audit fix to ensure your project's dependencies are up to date:
    ```shell 
    npm audit fix
    ```
1. Install the Angular CLI globally:

    npm install -g @angular/cli
    ```
1. Start the application locally:

Your local development environment should now be set up, and you can access the web app by navigating to http://localhost:4200 in your web browser.
